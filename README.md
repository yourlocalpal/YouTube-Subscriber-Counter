Why am I mixing python with batch files and vbscript? because I can! and its useful to my use case scenario. Put the VBs script in your startup folder and it will run this python file on every start up. To me, this is useful and cheaper than buying a 200$ hardware device that keeps track OR building your own counter with a rpi. OR making a C# app..
